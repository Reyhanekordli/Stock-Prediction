# Stock-Prediction
Hi
Here we have three stock market data with messy observations such as "high" , "Low" , "Open" , "Close" prices and "Volume".
First we clean the data.
Then find connections between USD/BTC/USDT markets and the fit the right ML model from sci-kit learn library into our features and target which is price of the next minute.
I also used GridSearch for finding the right parameters for RandomForestTree but it's not uploaded.
